<h3>Color Speed</h3>

<p>Color Speed determines how fast the ring color's <a href="../Color/Color_Model.htm">hue</a> cycles around the color wheel, in degrees per frame. The color's <a href="../Parameters/Lightness.htm">lightness</a> and <a href="../Parameters/Saturation.htm">saturation</a> are controlled separately; if lightness is 0 or 1, or saturation is 0, hue has no effect. The hue normally cycles a full 360°, but hue cycling can also be limited to a range, using the <a href="../Color/Loop_Hue.htm">Loop Hue</a> command.
