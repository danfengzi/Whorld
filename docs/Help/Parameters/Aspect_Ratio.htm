<h3>Aspect Ratio</h3>

<p>Aspect Ratio stretches the rings horizontally or vertically. Positive values make the rings wider; negative values make the rings taller. At zero, Aspect Ratio has no effect. Aspect Ratio is exponential, and normalized so that at 1, the rings are twice as wide, at 2 they're four times as wide, and at three, they're eight times as wide.
