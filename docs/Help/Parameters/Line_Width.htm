<h3>Line Width</h3>

<p>Line Width is the width of each ring, in pixels. It's displayed as a real number, but internally it's rounded to an integer. Note that the default line width of one is a special case: one-pixel-wide lines are typically drawn by hardware and execute <em>much</em> faster than other line widths. Line widths greater than one may cause <a href="../Loose_Ends/Performance.htm">performance</a> problems. As Line Width is increased, the rings begin to overlap unless <a href="../Parameters/Ring_Spacing.htm">Ring Spacing</a> is also increased.
