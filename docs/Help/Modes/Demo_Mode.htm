<h3>Demo Mode</h3>

<p>In demo mode, Whorld loads a <a href="../Playlists/Playlists.htm">playlist</a> called "demo.whl" from the program folder. This playlist includes <a href="../Patches/Patches.htm">patches</a> that demonstrate some of Whorld's capabilities. There's nothing magical about the demo playlist except its name: it's just another playlist, and you're free to modify it, but don't rename it or move it to a different folder. To enable or disable demo mode, select <span class="cmd">View/Demo</span>. While watching the demo, you can experiment with some of Whorld's effects; see <a href="../Getting_Started/Viewing_the_demo.htm">Viewing the demo</a>.
