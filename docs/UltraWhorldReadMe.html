<h2>UltraWhorld Freeframe Plugin</h2>

<p>UltraWhorld is an enhanced version of the original Whorld Freeframe
plugin (<a href="WhorldFFReadMe.html">WhorldFF</a>).  
The main enhancement is that UltraWhorld exposes
nearly all of the Whorld application's parameters and switches.  This
allows you to run Whorld from within your favorite VJ application, 
without sacrificing the Whorld application's extensive real-time 
controls; in short, the best of both Whorlds.  :) 

<p>UltraWhorld has an unusually large number of Freeframe parameters. 
Unfortunately some VJ softwares limit the number of parameters a
Freeframe plugin can expose.  UltraWhorld is most useful with VJ softwares
that don't limit Freeframe parameters, e.g. 
<a href="http://ffrend.sourceforge.net">FFRend</a>.

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Start by <a href="download.html">downloading the plugin</a>.

<p>Most softwares reserve a special folder for freeframe plugins.  If your
software does this, simply copy UltraWhorld.dll to the special folder.
Be sure to do this BEFORE launching your software, since it probably 
only checks for plugins during startup.  Otherwise, consult your 
software's documentation.

<p>IMPORTANT: In addition to installing the plugin, you may also want to
install some Whorld patches.  Use the following procedure:

<ol>
<li>Find your "My Documents" folder.  If you're unfamiliar with Windows,
there are various ways to do this.  One reliable way is to go to the
Start menu, select "Documents", and then select "My Documents".
<li>In your "My Documents" folder, create a subfolder called WhorldFF.
The subfolder name must be spelled correctly.  The subfolder's path
should look something like this (assuming you're the Administrator):

<p>C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\WhorldFF

<li>Copy the patches from this distribution into the WhorldFF
subfolder.
</ol>

<h3>Uninstalling</h3>

<p>Just delete UltraWhorld.dll and the Whorld patches, and that's all
there is to it.

<h3>Playlist Support</h3>

<p>UltraWhorld features the ability to load a Whorld playlist (.whl),
unlike the original WhorldFF plugin which only loads patches.  There
are two methods for loading a playlist in UltraWhorld: 

<ol>

<li>Create a special initialization file in "My Documents\WhorldFF" 
which directs the plugin to your playlist.  The file is plain text, 
so you can create it using Notepad or any other text editor.  The 
file MUST be called "UltraWhorld.ini", and it should contain a single 
line, consisting of the word "Playlist", followed by an equals sign, 
followed by the absolute path to the desired playlist, like this: 

<p>Playlist=C:\Whatever\MyPlaylist.whl 

<p>Replace C:\Whatever\YourPlaylist.whl with an absolute path to the
desired playlist.  Do NOT enclose the path in quotes.  It's OK if it
contains embedded spaces.  

<p>***OR*** 

<li>Copy your playlist to the "My Documents\WhorldFF" folder and then
rename it to "UltraWhorld.whl".  With this method, the playlist MUST be 
called "UltraWhorld.whl", otherwise the plugin won't find it.

</ol>

<p>NOTE that first method (.ini file) is preferable, because of a problem
with the way the Whorld application stores paths in playlists.  If you
choose to use the second method, you should check UltraWhorld.whl for
broken links, by opening it in the Whorld application.  If Whorld finds
broken links, it will give you an opportunity to repair them.  Be sure
the save the playlist afterwards.  

<p>If UltraWhorld doesn't find a Whorld playlist via one of the above
methods, it defaults to WhorldFF's behavior, i.e.  it looks for patches
in the folder "My Documents\WhorldFF" and loads them in alphabetical
order.  Note that in this case there will only be one bank.  

<h3>Parameters - Notes</h3>

<p>Some of UltraWhorld's parameters are switches, rather than continuous
controls.  There are two types of switches, boolean and event
(momentary).  According to the Freeframe specification, 

<dl>
<dt>boolean
<dd>0.0 defined as false and anything else defined as true.
<dt>event
<dd>Similar to boolean but for a momentary push button style 
trigger.  1.0 is set momentarily to trigger the event.  
</dl>

<p>An example of an event is Rotate Hue (90 degrees).  The way it works is
that the event is triggered when the parameter transitions to the value
1.0 (from any other value).  To trigger the event twice in a row, set
the parameter to 1.0, set it to any other value, and then set it to 1.0
again.  

<p>The last parameter (Save Patch) is a momentary switch which saves the
current settings as a new Whorld patch.  The resulting patch is saved to
the folder "My Documents\WhorldFF\Saved".  The filename is synthesized
from the current date and time.  This feature is handy if you develop a
cool setting in UltraWhorld and want to use it in the Whorld 
application too.  

<p>Finally, note that the X and Y position parameters don't do anything
unless Origin Motion is set to "Drag".  The Origin Motion parameter
works as follows: 

<dl>
<dt>0.0 to 1/3
<dd>Origin is parked: X/Y position parameters do nothing.
<dt>1/3 to 2/3
<dd>Origin can be dragged, using X/Y position parameters.
<dt>2/3 to 1.0
<dd>Origin makes random jumps, at frequency set by Tempo.
</dl>

<h3>Getting Help</h3>

<p>If you're able to run the plugin, but the patch slider doesn't do
anything, it's because the plugin didn't find any patches.  The most
likely reason is that you put them in the wrong folder.  Remember,
there's a unique "My Documents" folder for each user.  The plugin looks
in the CURRENT USER's "My Documents\WhorldFF", and nowhere else.  

<p>Some patches may cause performance problems, e.g.  the frame rate may
drop, or your software may become unresponsive.  If this occurs, here
are some things to try: 

<ol>
<li>Use a more powerful gamer-style PC.
<li>Use a lower-resolution video mode.
<li>Lower the Rings parameter.
<li>Figure out which patches cause trouble, and don't use them.
<li>Edit the patches to reduce their performance requirements.  
</ol>

<p>It may help to read the <a href="Help/Loose_Ends/Performance.htm">Performance</a> chapter in Whorld's documentation.
Briefly, any of the following can cause problems: wide lines, fill mode,
outline mode, x-ray mode, B zier curves, excessive poly sides, extreme
star factor, or excessive ring count.  The easiest solution is usually
to reduce the Ring count, either directly via the Rings master control,
or indirectly by increasing the Ring Spacing parameter.

<h3>Known Bugs</h3>

<p>When you change patches, the other parameters (Speed, Zoom, etc.) don't
snap to the new patch's values.  Sorry!
